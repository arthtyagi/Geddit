Geddit is an open-source web app that allows you to keep Notes and To-Do lists powered by a Django backend.

The project has two modules, the Notes app and the To-Do app : 

The Notes module is made using Django, Bootstrap and well, DHTML.
The To-Do app will be built using the same technologies as the Notes module.

### TO-DO :

- [X] Notes specific to individual users.
- [X] Signin using Email. 
- [X] To-do Lists specific to individual users.
### Projected Timeline:

Done.

### Fun shit :
 - [ ] Adding date picker
 - [ ] Redoing the UI in React.js
 - [ ] Public and Private Notes and Tasks.
 - [ ] Adding a How-To use this animator.
 - [ ] Support Markdown
 - [ ] Support Rich Text Editing
