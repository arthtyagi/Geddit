Geddit is an open-source web app that allows you to keep Notes and To-Do lists powered by a Django backend.

The project has two modules, the Notes app and the To-Do app : 

The Notes module is made using Django, Bootstrap and well, DHTML.
The To-Do app will be built using the same technologies as the Notes module.

### TO-DO :

- [X] Notes specific to individual users.
- [ ] To-do Lists specific to individual users. 
- [X] Signin using Email.

### Projected Timeline :

31st May, 2020.

Note : I won't be deploying this to production.
