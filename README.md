# Geddit

![code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41021374/86321791-5441da80-bc57-11ea-8e18-703536045d40.png)

Geddit is an open-source web app that is essentially a skeleton project of DomeCode with similar components. It is being used for testing purposes.
The project has two modules, the Notes app and the To-Do app and other upcoming modules.


The modules are made using :
- Django, ü¶Ñ
- Bootstrap üéÉ and well, 
- DHTML üëÄ
- React.js soon! üçª

## Upcoming Modules :

- Forums
- Resum√©
- FAQ

## TO-DO :

- [X] Notes specific to individual users.
- [X] Signin using Email. 
- [X] To-do Lists specific to individual users.
### Projected Timeline:

There's no such thing as timeline for Geddit, it's a project that will have various branches and will be a skeleton project to test new project. Albeit, a sandbox. So yeah, have at it! Fork this thing.


### What's new?

Well as of now, it has a fairly good responsive UI, notes, tasks, a search bar, Github Login, an upcoming forum, labels and images in notes. Increased the security of this repo by using decouple. More on the way since essentially all of these features are being ported over by me to [DomeCode](https://arthtyagi.me/domecode) except they'll be more polished and would hopefully make the end user spend more time on the application. ( Application since it'll be a PWA i.e. a Progressive Web Application as well ).

### Fun shit :
 - [ ] Adding date picker
 - [ ] Redoing the UI in React.js
 - [ ] Public and Private Notes and Tasks.
 - [ ] Adding a How-To use this animator.
 - [X] Support Markdown
 - [X] Support Rich Text Editing
 
### What does that look like right now?
